There have been some terrible winter seasons in the last couple of years, so snow removal companies are busier than ever. The director of a [Winnipeg snow removal](http://www.cleanrsnow.com) business asked me to build a Rails website for them. I don't know that much about the language, I know it takes some knowledge but I like to do things I can learn from, so I accepted the challenge.

So here I am, not really knowing how to start. Fortunately, I love reading and watching tutorials, so I guess that's the best thing I can do right now. I like the GitHub community, you can find answers to almost every question. Wish me luck!
